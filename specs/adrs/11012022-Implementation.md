## Context and Problem Statement

How to handle frontend?
How to handle backend?
How to implement storage?

## Decision 

- FrontEnd: Vanilla Javascript because everyone has knowledge of this language and is enough to serve our purposes without losing too much time on learning new frameworks.
- BackEnd: Create API endpoint utilizing Java so that we can do CRUD operations on our SQLite3 db. Have calls to these functions from javascript.
- Storage Implementation: Utilize SQLite3 to handle storing our data and use API endpoints to access it.
